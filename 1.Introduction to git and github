1a) What is Version control system
    A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps track changes in your code/files over time.
    You can save snapshots (versions) of your work.
    You can revert back if something breaks.
    You can collaborate with others without overwriting each other’s work.

1b) Centralized vs Distributed VCS
  Centralized VCS
    There is one central server that stores the codebase and all its history.
    Developers check out code from this central server, make changes, and then commit/push back.
    The server is the single source of truth.
    Advantages: Simple model → easy for beginners.
                Admins can control access since everything is in one place.
                Good for small teams.
    Disadvantages:If the central server crashes → whole team is blocked.
                  Developers must be online to commit changes.
                  Slower in large projects (constant communication with server).
    Example: Subversion (SVN)
 Distributed VCS
     Every developer has a full copy of the repository (code + history).
     Work can be done offline, commits are local first.
     Later, changes can be pushed/pulled to a shared remote server (like GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket).
     Advantages: No single point of failure. Even if GitHub goes down, your local repo has full history.
                  Work offline, commit anytime.
                  Branching & merging is much easier.
                  Faster operations since commits are local.
    Disadvantages: Slightly harder to learn at the beginning.
                   Repo copies can take more disk space (but storage is cheap now).

1c) - What is Git? What is GitHub?
  Git
      Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
      It was created in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux 🐧).
      Git tracks changes in source code and allows multiple developers to collaborate
      Key features
                  Distributed – Every developer has the entire repo + history locally.
                  Snapshots not diffs – Instead of saving just changes, Git stores snapshots of your files.
                  Branching & Merging – Create new branches, experiment, and merge changes back easily.
                  Speed – Most operations are local → super fast.
 Github
     GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories.
      It’s not Git itself, but a platform built on top of Git to make collaboration easy.
      Founded in 2008, later acquired by Microsoft in 2018.
      Key features:
                    Remote Hosting – Store your Git repos online.
                    Collaboration Tools –
                                        Pull Requests (PRs) → propose code changes.
                                        Issues → track bugs/tasks.
                                        Discussions → communicate with the team.
                    CI/CD with GitHub Actions → automate testing and deployments.
                    Project Management → Kanban boards, milestones.
                    Social Coding → Fork, star, and follow projects just like a social network.

1d) Install Git on Windows

    Go to the official site → https://git-scm.com
    Download the Windows installer.
    Run the installer:
    Choose editor (default is Vim, but you can select Notepad++ or VS Code).
    Keep defaults unless you know you want something specific.
    Make sure “Git Bash” and “Git GUI” are selected.
    Finish installation.
    Verify by opening Git Bash or Command Prompt and typing:
                     git --version
